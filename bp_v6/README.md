## Important: bp_v6 is our new Kenya prototype and currently not compatible with the old PCB on which this GihHub documentation is based on. This is a work in progress.

### New features
- SIM800L GSM wireless transmission
- HM10 Bluetooth transmission (not yet implemented in code)
- SHT31 Humidity / Temparature sensor
- SPS30 Particulate matter sensor
- Connector for UBLOX GPS
- Micro USB power plug

### Discontinued functions
- Accelerometer / Gyroscope
- LoRa wireless transmission


The measured power draw is around 70-90mA (while GSM is not trasmitting) at 5V supply, ~0.4W.
With a 10.000mAh powerbank you can keep the sensor running for about 5 days constantly (ideal conditions).
